✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using OpenCV and Python
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using computer vision techniques. It detects the number of fingers shown to a webcam and displays the count dynamically on the screen.

🔍 Features
Real-time finger count detection using a webcam

Region of Interest (ROI)-based hand tracking

Background subtraction with accumulated weighted averaging

Contour and convex hull-based gesture segmentation

Circular ROI for detecting finger tips

Live feedback with OpenCV overlays

🧠 Tech Stack
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

scikit-learn (for pairwise distance calculation)

🚀 How It Works
Captures video from the webcam.

Establishes background over the first 60 frames.

Detects hand region using background subtraction.

Segments the hand and identifies finger tips using contour analysis.

Displays the detected finger count in real time.

🎯 Use Case
This project serves as a foundation for:

Touchless gesture-based interfaces

Sign language recognition

Smart home or IoT control systems

AR/VR hand interaction modules



▶️ Run It
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-learn
python hand_gesture_recognition.py
